CrowdTrack is interesting mostly because of what it says about the current state of surveillance \u2013 we can do most forms of video surveillance, but still have trouble tracking multiple people in fast-moving real world crowds.\n\nWhat the dataset consists of:The dataset is made up of 33 videos containing 40,000 distinct image frames and over 700,000 annotations. CrowdTrack contains over 5,000 individual trajectories \u2013 objects that are tracked across multiple frames.\u201cAll data is collected in unconstrained daily environments, ensuring object behaviors remain natural and unmodified\u201d, the researchers write. \u201cWhile typical daily scenarios often involve slow-paced movement and low clothing similarity, we intentionally included footage from building sites to introduce unique challenges: workers\u2019 uniform workwear and helmets suppress facial feature discriminability, thereby emphasizing the importance of gait and body shape features for tracking.\u201d\n\nWhy this matters \u2013 scalable authoritarianism: One of the things that makes authoritarianism expensive is the overhead that comes from building out and running a large-scale police state. One of the things AI does is make it much, much cheaper to do large-scale surveillance. Datasets like CrowdTrack are a symptom of the way AI is making it cheaper and easier to do surveillance that the dictators of the 20th century would have fantasized about but always been unable to fully fund. \u201cOur dataset can be used for tasks like visual grounding, captioning, and appearance feature extraction,\u201d the researchers write.Read more:CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios (arXiv).Get the dataset and code here:CrowdTrack (CrowdTrack, GitHub).",

As self attention scales quadratically with sequence length, training and inference on long videos become prohibitively expensive, limiting model practicality and scalability,\u201d they write. \u201cThe key insight of Radial Attention is that attention scores between tokens decay with increasing spatial and temporal distance. This motivates us to allocate computation based on the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in video data\u201d.\n\nGood performance on real world models: The results are convincing: the authors show that they\u2019re able to get a 2.78X training speedup and 2.35X inference speedup on Hunyuan Video, a good video generation modelfrom Tencent.They also demonstrate similarly good performance (1.78X training, 1.63X inference) on theMochi 1 video model.\u201cAt default video lengths, Radial Attention achieves up to a 1.9\u00d7 speedup while maintaining video quality. For videos up to 4\u00d7 longer, Radial Attention preserves video fidelity and delivers up to 4.4\u00d7 and 3.7\u00d7 speedups in training and inference, respectively, with minimal LoRA fine-tuning,\u201d they write.\n\nWhy this matters \u2013 making it cheaper to do AI entertainment: The internet has become a vast engine for the consumption of video content \u2013 see social media shorts, YouTube, the streaming services, etc. Technologies like Radial Attention will help lower the cost of training and sampling from AI video models, which will make it cheaper to produce synthetic video content. Where the internet before was the place that we stored videos that were gathered from the world, it will now increasingly become a machine where people use internet-mediated services to generate videos, then internet-mediated services to propagate them as well.Read more:Radial Attention: O(nlogn) Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for Long Video Generation (arXiv).Get the codeforRadial Attention here (MIT-han-lab, GitHub).",

In the latter case, participants either talk (unknowingly) to other humans or to AI systems.Another important aspect of this study is that it is an incentivized one \u2013 people were paid money for their work, which means people tried harder than with usual studies; participants got paid for their time for the study, as well as getting paid a bonus for either being the most accurate quiz takers in their group, or for being most effective at persuading people.\u201cTwo critical features of our design include: a) verifiable questions (trivia questions and forecasting questions about near-future events), allowing us to look at truthful and deceptive persuasion, and b) rewards both for human persuaders (when quiz takers answered in the persuaders\u2019 assigned direction) and for quiz takers (for correct answers), allowing us to benchmark LLMs against humans when human persuaders and quiz takers are highly motivated,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe results:The authors found that LLMs are more persuasive than humans. \u201cOur study demonstrates that frontier LLMs such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet are highly effective persuaders, often exceeding the persuasive capabilities of incentivized human participants.\u201d LLMs are both better at guiding people towards correct answers (which makes sense, given we know LLMs are very effective tutors), as well as misleading people (which is likely helped by the fact LLMs are \u201cnot constrained by social hesitations, emotional variability, or fatigue that can influence human performance in these contexts\u201d, and are also far more knowledgable about the world than individual people so can make more compelling false arguments.)",
